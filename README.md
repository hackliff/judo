An attempt to extend juju software (https://juju.ubuntu.com/) for the service deployment thanks to the amazing docker (https://www.docker.io/)

First step : 
 * Build it in local

Require (from juju-core): 
 * Extend the lxc container definition with docker
 * Check the compatibility with ../golxc lib, and if necessary extend it as godocker

Next step :
 * Deploy through cloud...
